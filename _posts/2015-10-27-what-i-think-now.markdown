<p>After completing this job shadow I can’t say that the strength of my desire to enter this field has diminished by any 
factor at all. If anything, it only went to further to cement this path for me later on. Like I had said in an earlier post, 
computers and my interest in how they work has probably been the most constant thing in my life with the only exception being
last year in the most severe depths of my depression.</p>

<p>When I came to and left from my job shadow at Merchant Centric, I largely felt excited, which largely reflected the fact 
that I knew I could see myself doing this. Even if business analytics isn’t my favorite thing, the fun of being around other 
people who shared my interests/passions and imagining getting to do this for a living made me feel an extreme sense of 
anticipation.</p>

<p>I’ve been well aware even before doing the job-shadow of the down-sides of programming. You are going to have slightly
longer-than average work hours. If you’re in a smaller non-technical company, you’re likely going to run into bosses from
other professions who are going to want a bus that can drive like a ferrari, and they’re going to want it yesterday. That
being said, this is not ever universally the case at all jobs, and one of the virtues of programming is that it’s an in
-demand job. If I work for a company and don’t end up liking it, I’m not stuck there with no other options and nowhere else
to go.</p>

<p>The other virtue of choosing software development as a career, is that it has applications just about everywhere I might
have secondary interest in, which is the very same reason it’s become such an in-demand job. CERN? They need software
developers to manage the massive amounts of data that their colliders generate. Hospitals? They need massive computer systems
to manage their digitized patient records and other information. Automakers? They need programmers to write the software for
their ECUs (I’m looking at you, VW), infotainment systems, etc. The list of modern-day applications goes well on and on.</p>

<p>Hopefully, (and the odds look good), I’ll be on my way out from University in a few years either working for some hot-shot
technology company, or I’ll either be making my own startup creating something that I’m excited about doing. Whatever happen
, the biggest certainty is that this is what I want to do.</p>
