<p>So, a good question to ask, and one that may seem unobvious to some is: Why computer science? Well, it’s hard to explain
your passion to someone who doesn’t already share it, primarily because passions by their own inherent nature are opinions
and can’t fully be taught such as rules of science and the natural world might be. That being said, I can at least explain
why I have loved computers for as long as I can remember.</p>
	
<p>Since before I was even age one, I’ve been using computers on at least some level of comprehension. Even in 1999, I was
using basic children’s programs teaching me to do various types of simple puzzles and tasks. As I grew older, using computers
became more and more intuitive to me. And at the same time, the natural manifestation of human curiosity took over and I
cared less about how to use computers, and wanting to know more and more on “How does this automagical thing work?” In
pursuit of this, when I was age 6, I bought my very first programming book on Python. I learned the very fundamentals of
computer programming (e.g. control flow), and continued to build upon this more and more up to the point where I am right now
(not to suggest that I’ve stopped doing this).</p>

<p>Computer science and my interest in everything computers has been the most constant source of interest for me, where
others come and go. Because of this more than anything else, I know furthering this interest as a career is something that I
most definitely want to do, and it’s been easily one of the most obvious choices in my life for me. I know that a lot of
other kids in highschool and in my grade can’t say this for themselves, and for this at least, I’m grateful to not have this
as an additional stress factor or source of anxiety in my life. I don’t have a concrete image of exactly what specific
company or type of application I will be working on, but all I’m confident of is that it’s going to involve programming.</p>
