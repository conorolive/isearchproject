<p>Software developers are responsible for the creation and entire lifecycle of software from conception to eventual
deployment. The software written by software developers has many uses on computers, as well as in almost every modern
electrical appliance. Programs that have been written by developers have been used to power major components and embedded
systems of computers, phones, or even less inherently electronics-involved things such as car engines, thermostats, or
even microwaves.</p>

<p>Most software developers work in sedentary office environments, employed by various types of service firms or for
software development companies. Daily responsibilities are varied, but typically involve writing segments of code (i.e.
classes) for a larger codebase usually worked on by multiple employees with the number of other developers largely
depending on the size and demands of the company and project.</p>

<p>The median pay for a software developer as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2012, was $93,350 per year
and $44.88 per hour. The top 10% of earners brought in more than $138,880, while the bottom 10% of earners brought in
less than $55,190.</p>

<p>Career training to become a software developer in typical examples is typically done by earning a bachelor or masterâ€™s
degree in computer science. A PhD in the study can also (but is not usually) be obtained.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that most software developers completed a four-year degree, the majority of software engineers 
were self-taught prior to their admission into university. It is often said by those in the industry, that the learning
experience continues well after completion of university.</p>

<p>As the nature of computer science is one of rapid change, many developers continue to self-educate themselves long after
finishing their degrees. Due to the nature of self-teaching in computer science, it is actually not uncommon for
developers to have no formal education whatsoever, although it still remains as a corner case and not the norm.</p>
