<p>While I was doing my job shadow, I learned a good amount of advice from everyone there that I got the chance to talk with.
Most of the advice pertained to technical knowledge, which is by far my favorite type of knowledge. Some of it was stuff that
I already was aware of on some level (but was still helpful nonetheless), as well as some points that was definitely
intriguing to learn about.</p>

<p>For one, Bryan did a good job of explaining to me about the inner workings of their program short of giving me the actual
code itself. I was surprised, and glad nonetheless that I got the opportunity to learn about the inner workings and small
detail that reveal the true ingenuity and thought of detail that goes into the creation of a product, the details of which
can’t be truly shown from the outside perspective of a user.</p>

<p>Also, I got a ton of smaller bite-sized pieces of advice and opinions that definitely have help. One such piece of advice
is the usefulness of avoiding the use of a language that isn’t already well established and that many different people can
work on and contribute to, versus the giving into an employee who “refuses to work on or program in anything but x language,”
which can lead to all sorts of different downfalls in so many different ways.</p>

<p>Another piece of advice I got from one of Bryan’s co-workers, were some pointers about the suite of tools that he
personally found he liked for testing the functionality and performance of client-side javascript code and overall user-end
experience. He also made me aware of a book/series of ideas known as “Anti-Patterns,” which are common errors made in program
development that will always end in failure for the same reasons every time. The title is actually a parody of and a
reference to the better-known “Design Patterns,” described in a book by the infamous “Gang of Four.”</p>

<p>To add on further, one interesting piece of advice/information Bryan gave me, was that “Here, we use nothing other than
open-source software in our development.” I was already a personal believer in (although received conflicting opinions on
from people elsewhere), was the usefulness of free and open source software versus corporate-oriented APIs and programs (such
as the many infamous bloated Microsoft program and development suites). Despite what many corporate business owners would
think, open source projects (despite being created and distributed for free) are great, reliable, and proven platforms to run
business systems on or to create software with, and I was glad to hear the same from his experience.</p>
