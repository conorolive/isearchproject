<p>So, the primary and most beneficial part of this school assignment is the job shadow. Under the guise of this school
project, I sought out someone I could pester for a day and gain some further insight into the daily grind of what it’s like
to work as a developer</p>

<p>In the end, I ended up doing my job shadow at a moderately small business in Westlake Village, CA called Merchant Centric.
In short, they offer a simple to use online tool for business owners that allows them to access all of the sites where their
businesses have representation and can be reviewed. In this way, it acts as an aggregate, also compiling useful statistics
about an individual business or for chain-business and individual locations within the chain. It also allows through keyword
analysis to highlight the major complaints and issues behind the low reviews and has helped many businesses gain
powerful insight in how to improve their business and/or their business model.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the address, I felt a bit disoriented. The building and the rest of the campus in which it was located
was nondescript and had no clear entrance or lobby for which someone such as myself would be able to intuitively find.
Thankfully, I happened to walk past my mentor’s office window and he noticed me wandering around like a lost puppy and
shortly later showed me inside. The largest open area of the office was mostly the same type of dull-gray cubicle area that
you might envision where creativity and happiness goes to die. Thankfully though, this is not where my mentor or any of the
other programmers worked. Off to the corner of the space was a hallway that led to Bryan’s office. He introduced me to two
database guys cramped together in a semi-intimately sized room.</p>

<p>Before we also sat down in his office that he shares with two other programmers (although only one other was present
during my visit), he made sure to show me the break room where the goodies were stored, before I got to watch any real work
get done.</p>

<p>Overall the experience was highly insightful, but in ways that confirmed my prior-standing beliefs about what I expected
this type of job to be like. As a result, it definitely reinforced my love for all things computer science, and did very
little to turn me away from it as a career. And, although I usually feel guilty bragging, I’ll say that most of the people I
got the chance to talk to were very impressed by the fact that I came to the job shadow with as much prior knowledge as I
did. Of course, I still do lack the formal college education, but I’d like to think I’m capable of punching above my weight
class in that regard.</p>
