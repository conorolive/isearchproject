<p>The nature of my personality and breadth of my life experiences is a bit hard to fit all in a few breif paragraphs, but it's worth a shot, I suppose.</p>

<p>My name is Conor. I'm 16 years old and have been persuing the child-like curiosity of learning how the world works from when I was still a tiny person. One of
	my greatest areas of curiosity would certainly be computer science, but I still have wandering interests in other academic areas as well. Some of my other
	areas of interests and hobbies are cycling, lingustics, photography, computer graphics, and (ashamedly) video games. Right now, I'm still teaching myself Swedish,
	which can be reflected in the odd-sounding names of my git repositories and blogs. Hopefully in a few years I'll be away at university getting to persue all of my
	passions, but for now (and for better or worse), I'm still stuck in High School.</p>
